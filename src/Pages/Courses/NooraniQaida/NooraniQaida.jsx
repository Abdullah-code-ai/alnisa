       <p className='main-data-para'>Do you dream of mastering the Holy Quran recitation whether for you or your children? Reading the Quran Basics course is your first step to achieving your dream. You and your children will also learn how to read Arabic in this course.

It is important to know that Arabic provides diacritics. Diacritics tell you how to read Arabic words so you do not need to memorize their pronunciation. You will also learn how Arabic letters are linked together or separated, and how to read words, then short and long sentences. Moreover, you will be able to read Arabic supplications.

You will also discover the features of the Holy Quran’s writing, which differs significantly from conventional Arabic writing. We train you to read the entire Holy Quran at the next level during the course.

Your instructor will also instruct you on the phonetic Quran during the Reading Quran Basics session. You would be able to read the brief Quranic Surahs with ease thanks to him or her.</p>
